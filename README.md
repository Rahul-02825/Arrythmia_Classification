# Arrhythmia Classification using Machine Learning

This project focuses on classifying arrhythmia using machine learning techniques to improve the accuracy of diagnosing irregular heart rhythms.  We analyze electrocardiogram (ECG) signals to detect various types of heart rhythm abnormalities.  The project employs several machine learning models, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and potentially Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), to develop a robust classification system. Feature extraction methods like wavelet transforms (while mentioned in the initial prompt, this was not implemented in the provided code, but could be a future enhancement) can be used to enhance signal quality and reduce noise, enabling the models to accurately distinguish between normal and abnormal heart rhythms. The dataset used is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are evaluated. This project aims to create an efficient, automated system for arrhythmia detection, assisting healthcare professionals in the timely diagnosis and management of cardiac conditions.

## Literature Study (Summary)

* **Heart Disease Prediction:** Studies have applied machine learning models like Logistic Regression and Decision Trees to predict heart diseases using features like ECG patterns and demographic data, showing high accuracy in medical predictions.
* **Dimensionality Reduction Analysis:** Techniques such as PCA have proven effective in reducing the number of features without sacrificing accuracy, enabling faster and more reliable predictions.
* **Medical Image Analysis:** Machine learning models are increasingly used in analyzing medical signals, such as ECG data, where feature extraction techniques, like PCA, play a crucial role in improving classification performance.

## Data Preprocessing and Statistical Inference

* **Data Cleaning:**
    * **Handling Missing Values:** Missing values were imputed using the median or mode, depending on the feature type.
    * **Outlier Detection:** Outliers were identified and handled to avoid skewing model training.
* **Data Transformation:**
    * **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** PCA was applied to reduce the feature space from 279 features while retaining the most informative ones, eliminating collinearity and reducing overfitting.
* **Normalization and Scaling:**
    * **Standardization:** Data was standardized to have zero mean and unit variance, making features comparable and improving the performance of algorithms like SVM and KNN.
* **Statistical Analysis:**
    * **Correlation Matrices:** Correlation matrices were used to evaluate relationships between features and reduce redundancy.
* **Dimensionality Reduction:**
    * **PCA:** After PCA, the data was transformed into fewer, non-collinear principal components.
* **Target Variable Transformation:**
    * **Multi-Class Classification:** The target variable was divided into 16 distinct classes.

## Methodologies

* **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Classifies arrhythmias based on the majority vote among the K closest neighbors.
* **Logistic Regression:** Provides a probabilistic approach to classify normal heart rhythms or arrhythmias.
* **Decision Tree Classifier:** Creates a model using a series of decision rules.
* **Linear Support Vector Classifier (SVC):** Classifies ECG signals by finding a hyperplane.
* **Kernelized Support Vector Classifier (SVC):** Uses kernel functions to handle non-linear separability.
* **Random Forest Classifier:** Builds an ensemble of decision trees to classify arrhythmias.

## Libraries Used

* **NumPy:** Numerical computations.
* **Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis.
* **Scikit-learn:** Machine learning models, preprocessing tools.
* **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** Data visualization.

## Conclusion

Applying PCA improved both the accuracy and efficiency of machine learning models. The Kernelized SVC with PCA generally outperformed other models. This project highlights the importance of combining feature reduction with robust classification models.
